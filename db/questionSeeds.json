The parent component 'tileGroup' renders a list of child components by using each set of properties in the collection to create a new component. Right now I am individually mapping each property from the set to the child component but this will become cumbersome if the property count for a component increases and I'm sure there is a cleaner, simpler way to do it... How can I pass the full set of properties on to the child component without remapping each property?"],
