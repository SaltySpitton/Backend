have no pagination :
const options = {
  pagination: false,
}

paginate data
//offset: quantity of items to skip
//limit: quantity of items to fetch
//{ offset: 3 }: skip first 3 items, fetch 5 remaining items.
// { limit: 2 }: fetch first 2 items.
//select options for getting only title and description on each doc:{ select: 'title description', offset: 3, limit: 2 })
//use limit=0 to get only metadata (total documents): Question.paginate({}, { limit: 0 })


//query (condition), offset and limit:{ title: { $regex: new RegExp("mon"), $options: "i" } }, { offset: 1, limit: 2 })
/* example return
"docs": [
        {
          "title": "bezkoder Tut#5 Mongoose",
          ..
        },
        {
          "title": "bezkoder Tut#8 Mongoose Paginate",
          ..
        }
      ],
*/

//with custom return labels:
/*
const myCustomLabels = {
  totalDocs: 'totalItems',
  docs: 'tutorials',
  limit: 'pageSize',
  page: 'currentPage',
  nextPage: 'next',
  prevPage: 'prev',
  totalPages: 'totalPages',
  pagingCounter: 'slNo',
  meta: 'paginator'
};
Tutorial.paginate(condition, { offset: 3, limit: 2, customLabels: myCustomLabels })


limit = size
offset = page * size
 start counting from page 0.

If you read the fine print on cursor.skip( ): The cursor.skip() method is often expensive because it requires the server to walk from the beginning of the collection or index to get the offset or skip position before beginning to return result. As offset (e.g. pageNumber above) increases, cursor.skip() will become slower and more CPU intensive. With larger collections, cursor.skip() may become IO bound.  To achieve pagination in a scaleable way combine a limit( ) along with at least one filter criterion, a createdOn date suits many purposes. MyModel.find( { createdOn: { $lte: request.createdOnBefore } } )  .limit( 10 )  .sort( '-createdOn' )",
